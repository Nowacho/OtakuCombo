This SRC contains things from Frozed Club Development's SoupPvP, such as the Abilitys and Combat system.
# Note
This is an attempt to replicate Ghostly's ComboFly, I tried to replicate it in 3 hours, and this is what came out. This serves mostly as a base (if it can be considered a Combo base).

Directly I only tested if it loads the pl and if it loads, other than that I didn't even test it, I'm writing this at 6 in the morning and I want to sleep xde
